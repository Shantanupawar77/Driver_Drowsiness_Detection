# Driver Drowsiness Detection

## Overview
Driver Drowsiness Detection is a computer vision project that utilizes facial landmarks to monitor driver drowsiness in real-time. By analyzing eye blinks, it categorizes the driver's state as sleepy, drowsy, or active, providing timely alerts to prevent accidents due to drowsy driving.

## Features
- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness using facial landmarks
- Classification of driver states: sleepy, drowsy, or active
- Prompt alerts to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected
- Integration with a camera feed for effective monitoring in various conditions

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
- NumPy
- imutils

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `(https://github.com/Shantanupawar77/Driver_Drowsiness_Detection.git)`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the `app.py` 
2. Ensure the camera is properly positioned to capture the driver's face.
3. Pay attention to the real-time alerts provided by the system regarding your drowsiness level.
